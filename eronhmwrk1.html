     <p>I have been in love with Anita Bakers voice since the age of 5 which was 1986 to be exact.My uncle and I would take long trips to Los Angeles to visit family and friends.Since we were listening to stations similar to the Mojo,I had no choice but to memorize the songs.I knew her entire album and would sing every oldie song that came on the radio for roughly and hour on our retun trips from LA to Fontana.Which might also explain why my music taste is straight mellow moods etc.

     <p>While kids my age might have been listening to Madonna,Klimaxx and Whitney Houston I was listening to Anita Baker and James Ingram.I was raised as an only child and was around adults for the most part.I finally started to hang with kids my age finally My sister from another Mister Tiffany.She showed me another side of music such as the 90's band Intro,Shai and SWV.Now dont get me wrong I still would bang My Nirvana,Stone Temple Pilots and Areosmith.But when I wanted some soothing music,Anita was the one.
     My favorite things about Anita Baker:
     <ol>
     	<li>Started out in a group called Chapter 8</li>
     	<li>She is an Ohio native</li>
     	<li>Raised by foster parents</li>

     </ol>

     As you can see I love all genre of music.But when I had my choice to do Kareoke or talent shows I would choose an Anita Baker song.Her <strong>Songstress Album</strong> is one of my favorites.
